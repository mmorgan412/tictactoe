- Play my tic-tac-toe game made by me - Melanie Gelinas!
- This game was made using javascript, jquery, and an API.

- During my planning phase, I tried to make a list of all of the "small" problems that went into the final tic-tac-toe game.
  - I started with getting a game board to display, followed by allowing a user to click in the fields and show an X, then an O, then alterlate X and O's.  I then moved onto the trickier parts - including pushing the x or o to the correct spot in an array, ending the game and not allowing the game to continue.  I moved on from here to my log in process, then to the game API logic.  I completed the process with the reset game logic.

- Unsolved problems: show user additional game information
